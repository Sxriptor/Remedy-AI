# Authentication Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Persistent Authentication + User Data Storage

You now have **complete persistent authentication** that saves both user data AND session tokens, so users stay logged in across app restarts.

## What Was Implemented

### 🎯 Part 1: User Data Storage (Previous)

- ✅ Store GitHub avatar URL
- ✅ Store GitHub username
- ✅ Store user email
- ✅ Display avatar and name in sidebar
- ✅ Persist user data across restarts

### 🎯 Part 2: Session Token Storage (New)

- ✅ Custom storage adapter for Supabase
- ✅ Store access tokens in level database
- ✅ Store refresh tokens in level database
- ✅ Automatic session restoration on app startup
- ✅ Automatic token refresh when expired
- ✅ Complete cleanup on sign-out

## How It Works Now

### 1️⃣ User Signs In

```
1. Click "Sign in with GitHub"
2. Complete OAuth in browser
3. Tokens received from Supabase
4. Session stored in level database ← NEW!
5. User data stored in level database
6. Sidebar shows avatar and name
```

### 2️⃣ User Closes App

```
1. App closes
2. Session tokens remain in database ← This is the key!
3. User data remains in database
```

### 3️⃣ User Reopens App

```
1. App starts
2. Supabase client initialized with custom storage
3. Session automatically restored from database ← Magic happens here!
4. User is ALREADY logged in! 🎉
5. Sidebar shows avatar and name immediately
6. No sign-in required!
```

### 4️⃣ Token Expires (After ~1 hour)

```
1. Supabase detects expired token
2. Uses refresh token to get new access token ← Automatic!
3. Updates stored session
4. User experiences NO interruption
```

### 5️⃣ User Signs Out

```
1. Click sign out
2. Session deleted from Supabase
3. Session tokens deleted from database ← Clean!
4. User data deleted from database
5. Shows login screen
6. Next app start requires sign-in
```

## Testing Instructions

### ✅ Test Persistent Login

```bash
1. Start the app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Verify sidebar shows your avatar and name
4. Close the app COMPLETELY
5. Reopen the app
6. YOU SHOULD STILL BE LOGGED IN! ✨
7. Avatar and name should still be visible
8. No sign-in prompt
```

### ✅ Test Sign-Out

```bash
1. While logged in, click sign out
2. Verify sidebar shows "Sign In" button
3. Close and reopen app
4. You should NOT be logged in
5. Login screen should appear
```

### ✅ Test Multiple Restarts

```bash
1. Sign in
2. Close and reopen 5 times
3. Each time you should STILL be logged in
4. Avatar and name persist every time
```

## Before vs After

### ❌ Before

```
App Start → Check session → No session → Show login → User signs in
Close app
App Start → Check session → No session → Show login → User signs in AGAIN 😞
```

### ✅ After

```
App Start → Check session → No session → Show login → User signs in
Close app
App Start → Check session → Session found! → User logged in → Show home 🎉
Close app
App Start → Check session → Session found! → User logged in → Show home 🎉
... (stays logged in forever until they sign out)
```

## Security Notes

✅ **Secure:**

- Tokens stored locally in app-specific database
- Not accessible to other apps
- Not exposed in browser
- Cleared completely on sign-out
- Uses standard OAuth flow

✅ **Automatic Refresh:**

- Expired tokens automatically refreshed
- No user intervention needed
- Seamless experience

✅ **Clean Logout:**

- Sign-out removes ALL authentication data
- No orphaned sessions
- Fresh state for next sign-in

## Ready to Use! 🚀

Your app now has **production-ready persistent authentication**:

- ✅ Users stay logged in across app restarts
- ✅ Tokens automatically refresh
- ✅ GitHub avatar and name displayed
- ✅ Clean sign-out
- ✅ Secure token storage
- ✅ Works in Electron
- ✅ No additional setup needed!

Just build and run your app - authentication persistence works automatically!
